# About Me

Hi there! I am an aspiring low-level programmer and security enthusiast passionate about computer graphics, cryptography, and
binary exploitation. I participate regularly in CTFs. I am also a big fan of open-source software and I am always looking for new projects to contribute to. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching anime, and playing video games.
